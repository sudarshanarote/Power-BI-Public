RANKX ranks each row based on a specific measure or expression you define.

Syntax:- 
RANKX(table, expression, [value], [order], [ties])

Example:-
CustomerRank = RANKX(
    ALL(Customers),
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount])),
    ,
    DESC,
    SKIP
)


What this does:
ALL(Customers) removes any filters so the ranking is across all customers.
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount])) computes total sales per customer.
DESC ranks from highest to lowest.
SKIP means if two customers tie, the next rank is skipped (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).
