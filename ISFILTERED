ISFILTERED:- The ISFILTERED function in Power BI (DAX) is used to check whethera column is being filtered directly in the current context.
It's especially useful when building dynamic measures or conditional logic in visuals.

Example:-
You're tracking monthly sales performance. If the user filters by a specific Month, you want to show actual sales.
But if no month is selected, you want to show the average monthly sales instead.

SalesKPI = 
IF(
    ISFILTERED(Sales[Month]),
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    AVERAGEX(
        VALUES(Sales[Month]),
        CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]))
    )
)

What This Does:
If the user selects one or more months → shows total sales for those months.
If no month is selected → calculates average monthly sales across all months.
