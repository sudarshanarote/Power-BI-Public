In Power BI, the IF.EAGER function is a DAX function that allows conditional calculations while optimizing performance by evaluating all branches of the condition eagerly, regardless of the condition's result. It is primarily used in scenarios where performance optimization and pre-evaluation are desired for specific logic.

Key Features of IF.EAGER:
Pre-Evaluation: Unlike the regular IF function, which evaluates only the branch corresponding to the condition's result (TRUE or FALSE), IF.EAGER evaluates both the TRUE and FALSE branches simultaneously. This can be beneficial if the calculation logic in both branches is expensive, and you want to precompute them to improve query execution times.

Deterministic Behavior: Since both branches are evaluated, the function avoids potential performance penalties caused by re-evaluations of complex expressions.

Syntax:
DAX

IF.EAGER(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>, <value_if_false>)
<logical_test>: The condition to evaluate (e.g., Sales > 1000).
<value_if_true>: The result to return if the condition is TRUE.
<value_if_false>: The result to return if the condition is FALSE.
Example:
Using IF:
DAX

Sales Category = IF(Sales > 1000, "High", "Low")
Here, only one branch ("High" or "Low") is evaluated depending on the condition.

Using IF.EAGER:
DAX

Sales Category Eager = IF.EAGER(Sales > 1000, "High", "Low")
In this case, both the "High" and "Low" results are precomputed, regardless of the condition.

When to Use IF.EAGER:
Complex Expressions: When both branches involve computationally expensive or time-consuming calculations that can benefit from simultaneous evaluation.
Consistency in Calculations: To ensure deterministic behavior and avoid unexpected delays during condition evaluation.
Performance Tuning: For optimizing queries where eager evaluation can streamline execution paths.
Important Notes:
Not Always Necessary: In most cases, the regular IF function suffices, as it is designed to evaluate only the required branch.
May Increase Memory Usage: Since both branches are evaluated, IF.EAGER may consume more memory compared to IF.
By understanding the use cases and behavior, you can decide whether IF.EAGER suits your specific performance needs in Power BI.

How IF.EAGER Differs from IF
Feature	IF	IF.EAGER
Branch Evaluation	Evaluates only the required branch (TRUE or FALSE).	Evaluates both branches (TRUE and FALSE) regardless of condition.
Performance	Efficient for simple conditions.	Useful for optimizing complex and repetitive calculations.
Execution	Lazy evaluation (on-demand).	Eager evaluation (pre-computes both branches).
Use Case	General purpose.	When both branches need to be pre-computed or cached for performance.
Why Use IF.EAGER?
Optimizing Query Plans:

In some scenarios, lazy evaluation in the IF function can lead to unpredictable query execution times, especially when switching branches repeatedly. Pre-evaluation with IF.EAGER can create a more predictable and streamlined query plan.
Minimizing Redundant Computations:

If the same logic or calculation is required in both the TRUE and FALSE branches, IF.EAGER ensures this is computed once instead of twice, improving performance.
Improving Parallelism:

By precomputing both branches, Power BI's engine can utilize parallel processing, potentially reducing overall execution time for certain complex models.
Cache Optimization:

Eager evaluation ensures that both results are cached, which can help in scenarios where the condition might flip between TRUE and FALSE during iterative calculations.
Practical Examples
Example 1: Complex Conditional Calculation
Suppose we have a large dataset and want to categorize customers based on their spending, but the calculations for both categories are computationally intensive.

Using IF:

DAX

Customer Category = 
IF(
    [Total Sales] > 10000, 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]) * 1.2), 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]) * 0.8)
)
Here, only one branch is evaluated based on the condition, but the calculation might be re-evaluated multiple times.

Using IF.EAGER:

DAX

Customer Category Eager = 
IF.EAGER(
    [Total Sales] > 10000, 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]) * 1.2), 
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]) * 0.8)
)
Both calculations (*1.2 and *0.8) are precomputed, which can be more efficient in scenarios where the condition is checked multiple times.

Example 2: Avoiding Redundant Logic
Let’s say you need to calculate a discount rate based on a tiered system, but the discount formula is the same in both conditions.

Using IF:

DAX

Discount Rate = 
IF(
    [Sales] > 5000, 
    [Sales] * 0.10, 
    [Sales] * 0.05
)
The calculation [Sales] * X is repeated twice.

Using IF.EAGER:

DAX

Discount Rate Eager = 
IF.EAGER(
    [Sales] > 5000, 
    VAR DiscountHigh = [Sales] * 0.10
    RETURN DiscountHigh,
    VAR DiscountLow = [Sales] * 0.05
    RETURN DiscountLow
)
The calculations are pre-evaluated and can be cached for better performance, especially when nested in a larger report.

Advanced Use Cases
1. What-If Analysis:
IF.EAGER can be beneficial when performing complex What-If analyses where multiple conditions are checked, and you want all results pre-evaluated for quick toggling.

2. Scenario Planning:
In financial modeling or forecasting, when evaluating multiple hypothetical scenarios, precomputing both branches ensures consistent performance.

3. Nested Conditions:
In deeply nested conditional statements, using IF.EAGER reduces re-evaluation overhead, especially if the same sub-expression appears in multiple places.

Potential Drawbacks
Higher Memory Consumption:

Since both branches are precomputed, IF.EAGER can consume more memory, which might impact performance in memory-constrained environments.
Not Always Faster:

For simple conditions or lightweight calculations, the regular IF function is often more efficient.
Misuse:

Using IF.EAGER unnecessarily in simple scenarios may lead to overcomplication and resource waste.
When to Avoid IF.EAGER
For straightforward conditional logic or calculations.
When working with very large datasets where memory usage is a concern.
If your calculations are simple and don’t require pre-evaluation.
Summary
The IF.EAGER function is a specialized DAX tool designed for scenarios where pre-evaluating both branches provides performance or consistency benefits. While it’s not suitable for every situation, it shines in complex or repetitive calculations, What-If scenarios, and performance-sensitive models. Use it judiciously to balance performance and resource usage in Power BI.
