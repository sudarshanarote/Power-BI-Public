To Show total revenue for the current year, updating automatically as time progresses.

Steps I followed:
1. Loaded the sales data into Power BI
2. Created a DAX measure:
YTD Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Revenue]), 
    YEAR(Sales[Date]) = YEAR(TODAY())
)

(Or use built-in TOTALYTD() if a date table is set up)  
3. Added a KPI or card visual to display the revenue  
4. Set up a date table & marked it as Date Table for accurate time intelligence  
5. Formatted currency and added data labels for clarity

Result: A live Year-to-Date revenue figure — fully automated, no manual updates needed
